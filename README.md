Getting app to work
The dashboard and package directories mostly speak for themselves. To get the app to run, run the following lines:

yarn install to install dependencies
react-native link to add assets (fonts and images) to packages
If you want to install ios, run cd ios && pod install && cd ../
yarn start for hot reloading
iOS: yarn ios / Android: yarn android
